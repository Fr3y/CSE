/*
 * so as we have printed out hello world in 1_helloworld.c
 * now we are going to understand the whole code/Structure 
*/

#include <stdio.h>

  return 0;
}

/* now from starting we have 
 * #include <stdio.h> it is a pre processing command
 * it simply means that we want a file name of stdio.h 
 * int main = is a function we use function to break down the codes into piece
 * tip : int main is the starting point of the program
 * we can also use main() main means the starting point but now what is int here ? 
 * well int is an integer value now if we use int it means it will retuen int (a number)
 * now printf() is another function from stdio.h
 * now the last one return 0 it will retuen 0 to the OS
