/* 
 * Introduction to C 
 * C is a procedural language which means dividing giant programs into smalls functions and parts so ve can work on it easily 
 * the c programming is a iddle level language but it can be used as a low level too 
 * that's why people do confused c with other low level programming languages
 * so if you wanna understand difference between High Level language and low level it will be simply put in like this way that 
 * that in high level language = less efforts (high level of abstraction) 
 * low level = more efforts (low level of abstraction)
 *
 * Features of C 
 * Direct access to memory through pointers
 * bit manipulation using bitwise operators 
 * writing assembly code within C code (my fav)
 *
 *
 * C also provide wide variety of built in fuctions standard lib and header files 
 * now we will print out hello world or anything in next part
